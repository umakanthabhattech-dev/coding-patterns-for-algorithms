Leetcode 621. Task Scheduler
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n.
Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order,
but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.
Example 1:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2 Output: 8
Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again.
The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done,
so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
