Main generic Logic of sliding window pattern:
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the window's boundaries (e.g., start and end indices).
2. Use a loop to expand the window by moving the end index forward.
3. Inside the loop, update any necessary data structures or variables to reflect the current window's state.
4. Check if the current window meets the desired condition (e.g., size, sum, unique elements).
5. If the condition is met, perform any required operations (e.g., record the result, shrink the window by moving the start index forward).
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the end index reaches the end of the input data structure.
7. Return or output the final result based on the operations performed during the window adjustments.

sample problems that can be solved using the sliding window pattern:
1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
3. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
4. Find All Anagrams in a String
5. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
6. Permutation in String
7. Subarrays with K Different Integers
8. Count Number of Nice Subarrays
9. Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement
10. Sliding Window Maximum
These problems typically involve finding a contiguous subarray or substring that meets certain criteria,
making them well-suited for the sliding window technique.
